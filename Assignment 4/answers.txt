Question 1: For which of the three representations is the within-between ratio smallest?
Based off of my the ratios computed with BOW and the given ratios (texture mean & concat), 
it seems that texture mean had the smallest. 

Question 2: Does the answer to this question depend on the value of k that you use?
With all the ratios besides k=100, the valuse were unexpectedly high. To me I do think the k needs to be
somewhat specific in order to get a better ratio. 


Question 3: Does it depend on the number of keypoints you extract? (Try 500, 1000, 2000, 3000.)
I think it does. It also seems that with fewer keypoints (500 keypoints), that my ratios for BOW were
lower than the higher keypoints. 3000 keypoints might be an exception with one of the lowest being 0.334283

Question 4: Which of the three types of descriptors that you used is the best one? How can you tell?
I will say that texture mean seemed to be the best one considering the fact that it had the lowest ratio.
With the lower ratio, it allows for better detection for images that contrast one another greatly. 

Question 5: Is this what you expected? Why or why not?
I was hoping BOW to work because of it's ability to detect deformations
