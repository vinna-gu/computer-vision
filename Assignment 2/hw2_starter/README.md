# HW 2 --- Final Grade: 46/50

Notified grader the problem that I encountered:
There are some issues displaying the figure to show energy images, so in order to do so, I would comment out the figure containing the subplots in generate_results, and then it would display the energy of prague/mall. Also, the seam isn't showing on the prague.jpg and mall.jpg for some reason.
